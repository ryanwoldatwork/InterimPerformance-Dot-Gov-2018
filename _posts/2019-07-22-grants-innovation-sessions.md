The [Results-Oriented Accountability for Grants CAP Goal team](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/grants/) recently launched the *Innovation Exchange Sessions*, a monthly, virtual meeting to bring the broader grants management community together to learn about new ideas and approaches from fellow practitioners. Grants management practitioners include, but are not limited to, representatives from Federal agencies, state, local, and tribal governments, institutions of higher education, nonprofits, and auditors. These sessions provide a forum to share ideas, innovations, and best practices across the community that have the potential to improve grants management for all.

**Session Summary: Using Integrated Data to Support Practice (May 24, 2019)**
The first session focused on how the use of integrated data can help grant managers make more informed decisions and improve program results. Erin Dalton, Director of the Office of Analytics, Technology and Planning for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania joined the session to share the success the County has had since implementing standardized data practices and a shared IT system across county agencies. Specifically, she gave an overview of how data was used to support the Allegheny County Coordinated Care service. Read more about how they used data from eight categories to improve insights and decision making for at-risk children, youth, and senior citizens. View the [session slides](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/innovation-sessions/5-23-using-integrated-data-to-support-practice.pdf) and the [Allegheny County Analytics](https://www.alleghenycountyanalytics.us/) to learn more about how they used data from eight categories to improve insights and decision making for at-risk children, youth, and senior citizens.

**Session Summary: What’s the GIST of Your Grants Program? (June 27, 2019)**
The second session focused on the Grants Impact Story Tool (GIST), an integrated IT solution used to explain the story and impact of three sample Federal grant programs. GIST was developed during a sprint for The Opportunity Project (TOP), a collaborative effort among government agencies, technology companies, and nongovernmental organizations to translate open data from the Federal Government into user-friendly tools for public consumption. Rujuta Waknis, Grants Offering Lead for REI Systems, gave a presentation on how GIST helps to increase transparency and provide insight into how grant programs use Federal tax dollars. GIST provides information and visual dashboards to the grants community and can serve as a one-stop resource to solve real-world problems for families, communities, and businesses nationwide. View the [GIST Tool](https://gist.reisystems.io/), learn more about [The Opportunity Project](https://opportunity.census.gov), and view [the slides](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/innovation-sessions/6-27-the-opportunity-project.pdf) from the session.

The Innovation Exchange Sessions are held each month and focus on topics relevant to the Grants CAP Goal strategies for reducing burden and increasing program results. The team invites experts from in and outside of the government to participate and share their own innovative ideas and practices.

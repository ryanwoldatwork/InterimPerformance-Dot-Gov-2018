In December 2019, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) along with the [National Association of State Chief Administrators (NASCA)](https://www.nasca.org/) held the Service to Citizens in the 21st Century Summit, bringing together senior state and federal government management executives to strategize ways to improve and modernize service to citizens. This year’s summit focused on using shared services and consolidating management functions to efficiently and consistently deliver customer-driven results. We’ve rounded up highlights below:

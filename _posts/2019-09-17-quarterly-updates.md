**September 19, 2019** - Today, we published updates for both Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals and Agency Priority Goals (APGs) for the third quarter of FY 2019. These updates reflect strides made since our last update, and highlight recent milestones and performance accomplishments. In addition to the CAP Goal and APG progress updates, we’re excited to launch several new features on [Performance.gov](https://www.performance.gov/) that showcase cross-agency progress towards a more modern and effective government.

**NEW: Customer Experience Pages**
This quarter, for the first time, Federal agencies are sharing their plans to improve the way they serve their customers. The new [Federal Customer Experience page](https://www.performance.gov/cx/) connects the public to *CX feedback data*, *operational data*, and *digital analytics program data* to increase the transparency and accountability of 25 of the government’s High Impact Service Providers (HISPs). Learn more about the steps these programs are taking in our [HISP Highlights](https://www.performance.gov/cx/#highlights).

**NEW: Infrastructure Permitting Data**
Agencies have been making progress toward improving the complex permitting and environmental review processes for major infrastructure projects. For example, the environmental review and authorization decision process for the [Gulf LNG Liquefaction Project](https://www.permits.performance.gov/projects/gulf-lng-liquefaction-project-n), a [FAST-41 project](https://www.permits.performance.gov/sites/permits.performance.gov/files/docs/documentation/37401/fast41fact-sheet20181002.pdf), was completed 78 days ahead of schedule on July 31, 2019.  Additionally, Federal agencies have initiated the environmental review process for nine additional major infrastructure projects (MIPs) since last quarter. There are now 23 MIPs being tracked on the Permitting Dashboard and assessed under the [accountability system scorecard](https://www.permits.performance.gov/scorecard/2019/2) which include sectors such as surface transportation (highways), aviation, renewable energy (wind and solar), conventional energy (oil and gas), water resources, ports and waterways, and pipelines. To learn more, visit the Permitting Dashboard.

**Coming Soon: Burden Reduction Report**
As part of the Shifting from Low-Value to High-Value Work CAP Goal, agencies are shifting resources from outdated and redundant requirements and processes to accomplishing mission outcomes. They’ve delivered results, reporting more than 100 initiatives that collectively represent billions of dollars in realized and anticipated savings and hundreds of thousands of Full-Time Equivalent hours shifted to higher-value work. Next month we’ll release a comprehensive report detailing these initiatives and highlighting the significant progress toward a leaner government for the American people.

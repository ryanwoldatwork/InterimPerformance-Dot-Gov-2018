The Results-Oriented Accountability for Grants CAP Goal Team is excited to release draft Data Standards for public comment. The public comment period will stay open for 60 days beginning today, November 15, 2018 through January 15, 2019. 

Federal Grants Management Data Standards aim to modernize information technology solutions and contribute to a more streamlined approach to Federal grants management. Federal stakeholders have an important role in awarding grants, supporting positive and sustainable results, and ensuring good use of government funds in ways that benefit American taxpayers. Detailed feedback on these draft Data Standards help achieve the President's Management Agenda vision of modernizing the government for the 21st century.

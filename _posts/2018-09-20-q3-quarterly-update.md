As part of advancing the [President’s Management Agenda](../PMA/PMA.html), Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal teams released the latest quarterly progress on these high-priority federal initiatives. Agencies also released progress updates on their own Agency Priority Goals. The CAP Goal updates showcase what teams have achieved to date, while the APG updates reflect progress through June 2018. All of the progress updates highlight the milestones that teams continue to work towards as they advance the goals.

For more information about why goal teams provide quarterly updates, please visit the [Performance Framework](../about/framework_about.html) section, which includes an explanation of [CAP Goals](../about/CAP_about.html) and [APGs](../about/APG_about.html).

### A Few Highlights from the CAP Goal and APG Progress Updates

#### [CAP Goal: Modernize Infrastructure Permitting](../CAP/CAP_goal_12.html)

<img src="../img/CAP_icons/Icon_Modernize_Infrastructure_twitter.png" style="width:15%;float:left;margin-right:20px;" alt="CAP goal icon">The Permitting Council’s work has already saved $1 billion by avoiding permitting process delays. The team is focused on ensuring efficiency in the permitting process, breaking down silos through enhanced coordination, and providing oversight and issue resolution.

#### [CAP Goal: Category Management - Leveraging Common Contracts and Best Practices to Drive Savings and Efficiencies](../CAP/CAP_goal_7.html)

<img src="../img/CAP_icons/Icon_Category_Management_twitter.png" style="width:15%;float:left;margin-right:20px;" alt="CAP goal icon">The “Next Generation Package Delivery” solution saw a cost avoidance of $34.8M since it became available in October 2017 by helping agencies manage demand and timing of their shipments. This is just one example of how streamlining the way government buys goods and services is saving money and enabling the government to be stewards of taxpayer dollars.

#### [CAP Goal: Improve Transfer of Federally-Funded Technologies from Lab-to-Market](../CAP/CAP_goal_14.html)

<img src="../img/CAP_icons/Icon_Enhance_Technology_twitter.png" style="width:15%;float:left;margin-right:20px;" alt="CAP goal icon">The Army Research Laboratory opened its newest Open Campus hub in April 2018 at the George J. Kostas Research institute for Homeland Security at Northwestern University. This partnership will allow Army scientists to work with top research universities to find ways to make our warfighters safer and stronger. In addition to its main laboratories in Maryland, the Army Research Laboratory also recently established regional presences in California, Texas, and Illinois.

#### [APG: Department of Labor Job Creation: Apprenticeship Expansion](../labor/APG_labor_3.html)

<img src="../img/agency/Labor_Department_Seal.png" style="width:15%;float:left;margin-right:20px;" alt="CAP goal icon">DOL is working toward enrolling 1 million new apprentices to enable more Americans to obtain jobs that pay a family-sustaining wage through high quality earn-and-learn opportunities. From January 2017 through the third quarter of 2018, the DOL apprenticeship system added a total of 364,322 new apprentices based on preliminary results. On May 10, 2018, the Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion issued a Final Report to the President of the United States detailing a number of critical recommendations to modernize apprenticeship.

#### [APG: Department of Veterans Affairs Veteran Suicide Prevention](../veterans_affairs/APG_va_4.html)

<img src="../img/agency/Veterans_Affairs_Department_Seal.png" style="width:15%;float:left;margin-right:20px;" alt="CAP goal icon">Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is steadily increasing the use of interventions for Veterans at-risk for suicide through the use of predictive modeling and enhanced engagement strategies. As of June 30, 2018, 68% of Veterans targeted through predictive modeling algorithms within the VHA system received core recommended interventions—exceeding targets on the way to reaching a 90% goal by September 30, 2019.

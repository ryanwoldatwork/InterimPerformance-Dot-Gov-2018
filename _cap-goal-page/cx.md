#***********************ACCORDION SECTION*****************************
statement: "This goal will provide a modern, streamlined, and responsive customer experience across government, comparable to leading private-sector organizations."
 #first accordion text

challenge: "Citizens and businesses expect well-designed, efficient government services that are generally comparable in quality to that of leading private-sector organizations. Despite some important strides to improve customer experience, many federal government services fail to meet the expectations of the public, creating unnecessary hassle and cost for citizens, businesses, and the government itself. " #second accordion text

opportunity: "A modern, streamlined and responsive customer experience means:  raising government-wide customer experience to the average of the private sector service industry, as measured by external organizations; developing indicators for high-impact Federal programs to monitor progress towards excellent customer experience and mature digital services; providing the structure and resources to ensure customer experience is a focal point for agency leadership; and examples of programs where improved customer service will impact millions of Americans include Federal Student Aid, Airport Security Screening, National Parks, Veterans Health Care, Passport Services, Emergency and Disaster Relief, and Medicare." #third accordion text

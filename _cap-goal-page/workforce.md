#***********************FLOATING BOX SECTION*****************************

#***********************ACCORDION SECTION*****************************
statement: "Effective and efficient mission achievement and improved service to America through enhanced alignment and strategic management of the Federal workforce." #first accordion text

challenge: "The challenges include: parts of today’s personnel system are a relic of an earlier era that ill-serves Federal managers and employees; the Federal personnel system is unduly complex leading to a focus on compliance and transaction management rather than results and customer service; instead of agencies determining the best way to accomplish the mission, they map jobs in a fixed manner with outdated processes and functions; not aligning the workforce to mission requirements means the workforce is not being leveraged to meet emerging needs; HR IT systems are antiquated and not interoperable." #second accordion text

opportunity: "To achieve a state where Federal agencies and managers can hire the best employees, remove the worst employees, and engage employees at all levels of the organization. The Government must put a framework in place that drives and encourages strategic human capital management." #third accordion text

#***********************ACCORDION SECTION*****************************
statement: "This goal will:   improve the transition of federally funded innovations from the laboratory to the marketplace by reducing the administrative and regulatory burdens for technology transfer and increasing private sector investment in later-stage R&D; develop and implement more effective partnering models and technology transfer mechanisms for Federal agencies; and enhance the effectiveness of technology transfer by improving the methods for evaluating the ROI and economic and national security impacts of federally funded R&D, and using that information to focus efforts on approaches proven to work." #first accordion text

challenge: "The Federal Government invests approximately $150 billion annually1 in research and development (R&D) conducted at Federal laboratories, universities, and other research organizations. For America to maintain its position as the leader in global innovation, bring products to market more quickly, grow the economy, and maintain a strong national security innovation base, it is essential to optimize technology transfer and support programs to increase the return on investment (ROI) from federally funded R&D." #second accordion text

opportunity: "Agencies will develop and implement stakeholder- informed action plans which may include improved Federal practices and policies, regulatory reform, and legislative proposals; increase interactions with private sector experts; identify, share, and adopt best practices for technology transfer; and increase the transfer of federally funded innovations from lab to market." #third accordion text

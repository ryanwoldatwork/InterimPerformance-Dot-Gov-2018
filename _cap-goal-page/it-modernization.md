statement: "The Executive Branch will build and maintain more modern, secure, and resilient information technology (IT) to enhance mission delivery and productivity – driving value by increasing efficiencies of Government IT spending while potentially reducing costs, increasing efficiencies, and enhancing citizen engagement and satisfaction with the services we provide." #first accordion text

challenge: "The challenge includes: limited accountability for achieving enterprise-wide outcomes that enhance IT service effectiveness and reduce cybersecurity risks; slow adoption of cutting edge commercial technologies due to onerous acquisition and authorization processes; and federal agencies employ patchwork network architectures and rely on legacy systems that are costly and difficult to secure and upgrade." #second accordion text

opportunity: "There are opportunities to: expand the use of modern commercial technologies that are effective, economical, and secure; reduce the impact of cybersecurity risks by safeguarding IT systems, sensitive data, and networks; leverage common solutions and innovative practices to improve efficiency, increase security, and ultimately meet citizens’ needs." #third accordion text

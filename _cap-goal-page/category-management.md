#***********************FLOATING BOX SECTION*****************************

#***********************ACCORDION SECTION*****************************
statement: "The Federal Government will buy common goods and services as an enterprise to eliminate redundancies, increase efficiency, and deliver more value and savings from the government’s acquisition programs. By the end of FY 2020, the Government will have achieved $40 billion in savings for taxpayers in five years by applying category management principles—or smart decision-making where agencies buy the same kinds of goods and services through best-value contract solutions—to 60% of common spend. The Government also will reduce duplicative contracts by 50,000, potentially reducing administrative costs by hundreds of millions of dollars. In addition, by the end of FY 2025, 75% of common spend will be through managed solutions while continuing to meet small business objectives. " #first accordion text

challenge: "The Federal Government spends over $350 billion on common goods and services each year. However, agencies buy in a fragmented manner and taxpayers often do not get the benefit of the Government’s position as the largest buyer in the world. Hundreds - and in some cases thousands – of duplicative contracts are awarded to the same vendors for similar requirements. This fragmentation leads agencies to pay significantly different prices – sometimes varying by over 300% – for the same items. " #second accordion text

opportunity: "The Government will not only save taxpayer dollars, but this effort also will improve mission outcomes. For example, this will allow our law enforcement personnel to have easier access to equipment, such as ammunition and body armor, to ensure their safety; medical professionals can order medical supplies through electronic catalogues to save time and focus more on patients; and agencies can buy standardized computers to reduce cyber risk by having greater control over infrastructure and access points.

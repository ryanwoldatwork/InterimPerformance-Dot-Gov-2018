#***********************FLOATING BOX SECTION*****************************

#***********************ACCORDION SECTION*****************************
statement: "This goal will:   improve business, financial, and acquisition outcomes; enable Federal executives to make data-driven decisions and analyze trade-offs between cost, quality, and value of IT investments; reduce agency burden for reporting IT budget, spend, and performance data by automating the use of authoritative data sources; and enable IT benchmarking across Federal Government agencies and with other public and private sector organizations."
#first accordion text

challenge: "The Federal Government spends at least $90 billion annually on IT, and Federal executives have long known they could better manage that spending with increased visibility and more accurate data. Congress and taxpayers have pressed for better information about how Federal IT dollars are spent and the return on that investment. The FY 2018 President’s Budget reported 84% of the total Federal IT budget categorized as “other,” as opposed to being clearly tied to a specific IT category of spend. This lack of granularity makes it difficult to baseline Federal investments and show the public whether Government is spending taxpayer dollars effectively in order to drive the large scale change needed to improve business transformation and citizen services. In the spring of 2017, Office of Management and Budget guidance called on agencies to begin adopting elements of the Technology Business Management framework - an open source standard for IT costs. This will provide more granularity in IT spend based upon a taxonomy broadly accepted across both private and public sector organizations." #second accordion text

opportunity: "The TBM Framework will enable the Federal Government to:   run IT like a business; drive innovation and business transformation; improve services to citizens; add cost transparency; and increase accountability to taxpayers. " #third accordion text

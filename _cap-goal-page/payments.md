#***********************ACCORDION SECTION*****************************
statement: "Demonstrate stewardship of taxpayer dollars by reducing monetary loss and making payments correctly the first time." #first accordion text

challenge: While improper payments may compromise citizens’ trust in government, they are not always indicative of fraud, nor do they necessarily represent payments that should not have been made. Having the right information and the capacity to address root causes are critical components. #second accordion text

opportunity-bullets: yes

opportunity-bullet-1: "To improve the efficiencies of government programs by focusing on getting government payments right the first time they are made and reducing the cost associated with an incorrect payment." #third accordion text

opportunity-bullet-2: "Build trust in government by better understanding the nature of improper payments and their relationship to payment integrity."

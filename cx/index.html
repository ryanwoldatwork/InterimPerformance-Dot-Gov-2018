      <p>The Customer Experience Cross-Agency Priority Goal and OMB Circular A-11 Section 280 begin to raise the standard of service by first focusing on applying proven practices to High Impact Service Providers (HISPs). These 25 services across the
        Federal Government have been identified due to the scale and impact of their public-facing services.

      </p>
      <p>
        Bringing Olympic National Park Wilderness permits onto recreation.gov has saved more than 5,000 staff hours in less than one year and has shifted the customer experience from burdensome time waiting in line, on the phone, sending faxes or
        emails, and enables visitors to know immediately whether their reservations are secured.

        <strong><a href="https://www.dmi.org/page/2015DVAOPM">The National School Lunch Program</a></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The National School Lunch Program provides low-cost or free lunches to 30 million children living at or below the poverty level each school day. On the customer side, the application process was very challenging, leaving out children that
        needed access to healthy meals. On the Federal side, there was a potential of 1.8 billion dollars in improper payments going back to schools. A journey mapping process led to a redesigned application form.

      <p>
        Government typically approaches improvement and implementation from a bureaucratic, organizational-centered view. To better tackle barriers experienced by those leaving the military and entering the labor market, we built a journey map from
        the perspective of actual people living this moment – and showed how points at which multiple Federal agencies were involved were often also the most confusing to the user.

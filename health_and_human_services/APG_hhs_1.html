      <p><b>Goal Statement:</b><p>
        <p>End the HIV epidemic by reducing new HIV infections through 1) linking people to HIV medical care as quickly as possible so that treatment can be initiated; and 2) preventing HIV through prescribing pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to those who have indications for PrEP.  Starting from the baselines for September 30, 2016, by September 30, 2021:
         <ul>
         <li>Reduce by 15 percent new HIV infections among persons aged 13 or older.</li>
         <li>Increase by 15 percent linkage to HIV medical care within one month of diagnosis among persons aged 13 or older.</li>
         <li> Increase by 15 percent the number of persons with indications for PrEP who are prescribed PrEP.</li>
         </ul>
     </p>
<!--<p><strong>Implementation Action Plans will be available with the Q1 FY 2018 performance update.</strong></p>-->
